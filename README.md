# Chemistrable
Python 3.6.0

##Definition

**Chemistrable:** a word is Chemistrable if and only if it can be written as a combination of symbols of chemical elements on the Mendeleev table.

**chemistrable.py**: Finds combinations of chemical elements symbols that form a given word, and determines if a given word is 'Chemistrable' or not.

**build_list_JT.py**: builds an expanded list of word combinations for words that can be written as combinations of chemical symbols, based on Jeff Thomspon's list.

I would like to thank Jeff Thompson for this list, which helped me debug my program.

Future developments: 
- A desktop or web interface (most likely will start with the later)
- A more or less comprehensive list of English words that are Chemistrable
- A list of given names that are Chemistrable
- Lists of Chemistrable words in other languages
