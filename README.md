# Chemistrable
# Python 3.6.0
Chemistrable.py: Finds combinations of chemical elements symbols that form a given word, and determines if a given word is 'Chemistrable' or not.
build_list_JT.py: builds an expanded list of word combinations for words that can be written as combinations of chemical symbols, based on Jeff Thomspon's list.

I would like to thank Jeff Thompson for this list, which helped me debug my program.

Future developments: a desktop or web interface (most likely will start with the later)
